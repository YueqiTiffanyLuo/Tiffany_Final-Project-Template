    "text": "Physical amenities can be related to sentiments about community health condition. Therefore, I ran a OLS regression to explore the correlation between the number of health center and number of parks in one neighborhood and percentage of adults who rate their health as “fair” or “poor” (sentiments of how people think of their health conditions). Regression analysis helps in understanding the relationships between different variables. In this case, it helps determine whether there is a statistically significant correlation between the number of health centers and parks and the perceived health conditions of adults in a neighborhood. Understanding the factors that influence perceived health conditions can guide public health interventions. For example, if there is a positive correlation, it might indicate that improving access to health centers and recreational spaces positively affects residents’ health perceptions. This information can be valuable for policymakers, urban planners, or health professionals to identify areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID_1\nOBJECTID\nDIST_NAME\nABBREV\nShape__Area\nShape__Length\nPlanningDist\nDaytimePop\ngeometry\nhealth_centers_count\nnum_health_center_per_area\nparks_count\nnum_parks_per_area\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n14\nRiver Wards\nRW\n2.107270e+08\n66931.595020\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2711323.754 255818.110, 2711628.628 ...\nNaN\nNaN\n21\n0.006289\n0.282\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nNorth Delaware\nNDEL\n2.700915e+08\n89213.074378\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2743358.021 274541.170, 2743413.946 ...\nNaN\nNaN\n28\n0.006534\n0.221\n\n\n2\n3\n0\nLower Far Northeast\nLFNE\n3.068529e+08\n92703.285159\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2747427.678 297865.068, 2747454.031 ...\nNaN\nNaN\n17\n0.003487\n0.162\n\n\n3\n4\n9\nCentral\nCTR\n1.782880e+08\n71405.143450\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2697746.272 241701.844, 2697962.079 ...\n8.0\n0.002835\n77\n0.027284\n0.136\n\n\n4\n5\n10\nUniversity Southwest\nUSW\n1.296468e+08\n65267.676141\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2686719.537 239936.817, 2686992.274 ...\n6.0\n0.002924\n16\n0.007798\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

In this case, the R-squared is 0.025, suggesting that only a small percentage (2.5%) of the variability in Percentage is explained by the independent variables. The p-values associated with each coefficient test the null hypothesis that the corresponding coefficient is zero. High p-values (&gt; 0.05) indicate that the corresponding independent variable is not statistically significant. In summary, based on this analysis, there is little evidence to suggest a significant linear relationship between the independent variables num_health_center_per_area and num_parks_per_area and the dependent variable Percentage. Therefore, the number of health center and number of parks in one neighborhood don’t have much correlation with how people think of their health conditions.\nAlthough there is not much correlations among the three indicators, it could be meaningful to create a Community Health Index by aggregating the number of health centers, number of parks, and the percentage of adults rating their health as “fair” or “poor”."

Indicators of Community Health Level: Explore Community Health Survey, Health Centers, and Parks\n\n\n18\n\n\nThe City of Philadelphia’s Department of Public Health conducted the Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC) Household Health Survey for the 18 planning districts in City of Philadelphia. The community-score dataset below shows the percentage of adults who rate their health as “fair” or “poor” in response to the question, “In general, would you say that your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?”. Two years of Household Health Survey data (2012 and 2014/15) were combined to provide more reliable estimates by planning district. For more information, please visit: https://healthexplorer.phila.gov/planning-districts/. This dataset can represent the subjective view of the health condition of individuals, which is important for this project in understanding the community health level across different neighborhoods in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nYou may hover on this interactive map to see the percentage of adults who rate their health as “fair” or “poor” in neighborhoods of Philadelphia. From the map, we can see neighborhoods with the highest percentages are neighborhoods named North, Lower North, and Lower South West.\nNext, we can look at the distribution of health centers in each neighborhood, which might be an indicator for the community health level. I got the health center location data from Open Data philly, joined the dataset to the planning district, and calculated the number of health center by the area size for each neighborhood. I’m using hexbins here for better visualization.\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nYou may hover on this interactive map to see the number of health center per neighborhood in Philadelphia. From the map, you can see neighborhoods with the highest number of health center by the area size is the Lower North neighborhood. The neighborhoods in grey are the ones that have no health centers at all.\nParks provide open spaces for recreational activities, exercise, and sports. Access to green areas encourages people to engage in physical activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, or playing sports. Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good health, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and promoting overall well-being. Therefore, parks can also be an indicator of community health level.\nI got the park location data from Open Data philly, joined the dataset to the planning district, and calculated the number of park by the area size for each neighborhood.

    "text": "A shorter walking distance to health centers ensures that community members have easier access to healthcare services. In emergency situations, such as accidents or sudden illnesses, quick access to a health center can be a matter of life and death. Shorter walk distances can improve emergency response times. When health centers are within walking distance, individuals are more likely to schedule and attend regular check-ups and screenings, contributing to preventive care and early detection of health issues. Therefore, we can conduct the walkability analysis for health centers in Philadelphia. Here, I used 2km as the walking distance. I used the OSM network data and the corresponding API to do this osmnx analysis. The returning processed graph is shown with 199,029 nodes. I plotted the walking distance to the nearest health center for each point in the network. Please note that, due to quarto render memory restriction, I’m not able to upload some of the generated visulaizations to the website. Therefore, I’m inserting screenshots below to show the results that I ran in the Jupyter notebook.\nPlease make sure to open the interactive html files called interactive_healcenter_distance.html and interactive_park_distance from the main folder to navigate the walkability analysis.

the map above, each star represents a health center in Philadelphia, and the blue-yellow colors around them represents distances in the surrounding area that has a walking distance (2km) to the closest health center. Since it is a static map, the result may not be the most ideal for visulization, so I include an interactive visulization as shown below.\n\n\n\nhealth_center_interface\n\n\nI used folium and OpenStreetMap to build this interactive visulization. From this map, each red pin represents a health center, and you can see the health center name by clicking it. You can also zoom in and click the nodes see their distance to the nearest health center.\nSimilarly, walking distance to park can also be worthwhile to explore. Parks provide spaces for physical activities and exercise. Short walk distances to parks encourage community members to engage in regular physical activity, promoting overall fitness and reducing the risk of lifestyle-related diseases.\nUsing the same method as for the health centers, I plotted the walking distance to the nearest park for each node in the

the map above, each star represents a park in Philadelphia, and the blue-yellow colors around them represents distances in the surrounding area that has a walking distance (2km) to the closest park. Since it is a static map, the result may not be the most ideal for visulization, so I include an interactive visulization as shown below.\n\n\n\npark_interface\n\n\nI used folium and OpenStreetMap to build this interactive visulization. From this map, each red pin represents a health center, and you can see the health center name by clicking it. You can also zoom in and click the nodes see their distance to the nearest health center."

    "text": "Inspired by the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index’s methodology that combines multiple socioeconomic and demographic indicators to assess a community’s vulnerability to various stressors, the Community Health Index I create below can help identify vulnerable communities in terms of health level. It may reveal areas where residents face challenges related to healthcare access, recreational opportunities, and self-perceived health, all of which contribute to vulnerability.\nAggregating these variables provides a more comprehensive assessment of community health. Rather than considering each factor in isolation, the Community Health Index captures both healthcare infrastructure (health centers and parks) and the subjective health perceptions of residents. By combining different aspects of community health, the index offers a more holistic understanding of the overall health environment in a neighborhood.\nI used sklearn to normalize and transform the columns of ‘num_health_center_per_area’, ‘num_parks_per_area’, and ‘Percentage’ in the dataset to make them in the scale of 0-1. Then I aggregate them together to create a raw score. Finally, I created 5 groups and gathered the raw scores in the 5 groups from low to high (1-5), I also assigned lables for the groups to indicate the level of community health level, which low being the places with low health score (resilience) and high being the places with high health score (resilience). Places in low health score are the places need future supports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID_1\nOBJECTID\nDIST_NAME\nABBREV\nShape__Area\nShape__Length\nPlanningDist\nDaytimePop\ngeometry\nhealth_centers_count\nnum_health_center_per_area\nparks_count\nnum_parks_per_area\nPercentage\nnum_health_center_per_area_normalized\nnum_parks_per_area_normalized\nHealth_normalized\nraw_score\ncommunity_health_score\ncommunity_health_level\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n14\nRiver Wards\nRW\n2.107270e+08\n66931.595020\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2711323.754 255818.110, 2711628.628 ...\nNaN\nNaN\n21\n0.006289\n0.282\nNaN\n0.215610\n0.718\n0.933610\n1\nLow\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nNorth Delaware\nNDEL\n2.700915e+08\n89213.074378\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2743358.021 274541.170, 2743413.946 ...\nNaN\nNaN\n28\n0.006534\n0.221\nNaN\n0.224746\n0.779\n1.003746\n2\nRelatively Low\n\n\n2\n3\n0\nLower Far Northeast\nLFNE\n3.068529e+08\n92703.285159\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2747427.678 297865.068, 2747454.031 ...\nNaN\nNaN\n17\n0.003487\n0.162\nNaN\n0.110909\n0.838\n0.948909\n2\nRelatively Low\n\n\n3\n4\n9\nCentral\nCTR\n1.782880e+08\n71405.143450\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2697746.272 241701.844, 2697962.079 ...\n8.0\n0.002835\n77\n0.027284\n0.136\n0.721902\n1.000000\n0.864\n2.585902\n5\nHigh\n\n\n4\n5\n10\nUniversity Southwest\nUSW\n1.296468e+08\n65267.676141\nNaN\nNaN\nPOLYGON ((2686719.537 239936.817, 2686992.274 ...\n6.0\n0.002924\n16\n0.007798\nNaN\n0.746688\n0.271978\nNaN\n1.018666\n3\nModerate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\nYou may hover on the interactive map here to see the community health scores and their correspoding levels. It shows that neighborhoods with the highest scores are the ones in central Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n\nI also created a “hotspot” map to highlight the neighborhoods with lowest community health score (1), it means that these neighborhoods either has low number of parks/health centers or their residents have poor/fair health perceptions to themselves. Those neighborhoods, including Lower Southwest, River Wards, Central Northeast, and Upper Far Northeast are the nones that most in need of help and targeted interventions. In the context of this project, only three indicators are used. The next step would be adding more physical and social indicators and categorize them, in order to present a more comprehensive view for the community health level in Philadelphia.\nIn conclusion, this index can guide resource allocation by highlighting areas with lower Community Health Index values. Policymakers and health organizations can prioritize these areas for targeted interventions, aiming to improve overall health and well-being.\nThe index serves also as a tool for public health planning and decision-making. It enables the identification of areas that may benefit most from interventions, whether they involve increasing healthcare facilities, enhancing green spaces, or implementing health education programs."
